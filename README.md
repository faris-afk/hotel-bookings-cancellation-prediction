# Hotel Booking Cancellation Forecasting

Hotel booking cancellations are a significant issue in the hotel industry, leading to substantial revenue losses. Cancellations are often unpredictable and depend on various factors such as deposit type, customer profile, and seasonality. Therefore, forecasting demand and cancellation probability for each booking is crucial for hotel managers to optimize their pricing, inventory, and operational strategies.

XYZ, a tourism company, has been experiencing numerous cancellations in some of their hotels. They require a classification machine learning model to forecast whether a customer will cancel their booking. This project aims to build a classification model using the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset.

## Exploratory Analysis

Before creating the model, an exploratory analysis was performed on the dataset. The following insights and recommendations were composed based on the analysis:

1. **Target Market**: Both hotels are very popular in European countries, especially Portugal. XYZ should target more guests from these countries and explore market potential in nearby countries, as the citizens may have similar preferences or needs. They should also increase their customer loyalty by customizing their services based on these countries' cultures, such as serving Southern European dishes or offering promos on these countries' national holidays.

2. **Seasonal Pattern**: Both hotels have a similar seasonal pattern where customer arrivals peak in August and are lowest in January. The company should prepare for their services in the summer season, especially in August. This recommendation is also supported by the fact that summer is the holiday season in most European countries, especially Portugal. The company should also acknowledge that their hotels are not popular in winter, with the lowest arrivals in January, and will gradually rise again at the end of winter (February).

3. **Cancellation Policy**: In both hotels, cancellations are highest in Summer, which makes sense as reservations also peak at Summer. To address this, the company may have to implement policies to discourage cancellations, especially in the Summer seasons when demand is high. For example, the company can charge a cancellation fee.

4. **Revenue Generation**: There is a significant difference between the average daily rate generated by city hotels compared to resort hotels. City hotels generate a higher `idr`. XYZ should focus on their city hotel, as it generates more revenue for them.

## Model Performance

The models created in this project show a perfect or almost perfect precision test. This means the model can almost always correctly guess the canceled reservations.

## Model Analysis

After analyzing each feature's importance based on the model, it was found that deposit type is the biggest factor deciding whether a customer will cancel their booking or not. Further analysis identified that bookings with Non-Refundable deposit type have an almost 100% cancellation rate. To address this, XYZ can review their refund policy. For example, they could remove the Non-Refundable choice while adding a deposit type called Partially Refundable.
